## Uses
This process has been used to exemplify abilities in data processing and transformation across different file types while also demonstrating abilities to make complicated data joins.

This is an exploratory analysis on three different data sources; one containing daily temperatures for nearly 3000 cities, another containing the change in forest area and change in number of threatened species over time for 171 countries and a third containing the values of various air pollutants and air qualities in cities. This research could be built upon to predict areas that have potential for poor air quality rating.
