# About Me
I recently graduated with my Masters of Science in Data Science and I am eager to showcase all that I have learned through the program. In addition to my education, I have 2 years of real-world experience in a heavy analytical role in the CPG world.

This portfolio will showcase my skills as a data scientist, specifically my abilities to process data, build predictive models, and analyze complex statistical results.
