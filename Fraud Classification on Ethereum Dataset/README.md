## Uses
This research utilizes publicly available Ethereum transaction data to build a classification model to predict fraudulent transactions. Models such as this one can be used to reduce the number of fraudulent transactions allowed in a business's payment systems to ultimately increase profitability of the company. 
## Research Questions
* How can you apply classification algorithms to predict fraudulent transactions?
* What is the best model for this dataset?
* How can you balance type I and type II error in a model such as this one?
