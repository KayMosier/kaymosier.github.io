## Uses
This project uses two datasets form the UC Irving Machine Learning Repository to build a machine learning model to pair measurable physiochemical properties of wine with qualitative sensory data. The ultimate goal of this model is to remove human opinon from the mix and build a model that can accurately predict the quality of a bottle of wine using only the provided physiochemical properties. 
## Research Questions
1. What features most strongly effect quality rating?
2. Are there different predictors for red wine versus white wine?
3. What is the best model to predict quality of wine?
